# Image_Classification Using Machine Learning
Create and Train Model which will predict given hand-written digits images and will be able to distinguish between images with a very highest accuracy.

## Objective :
Predict handwritten digits with MNIST image dataset

### Acknowledgement : 
Dataset is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dillsunnyb11/digit-recognizer/tasks"> Kaggle </a>

## Structure :

### Task 1 : Importing all Essential Libraries
* Loading the dataset.

### Task 2 : Creating a Function to print images

### Task 3 : Spliting Data 

### Task 4 : Applying Algorithms
*  Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and  Naive Bayes
* Check accuracy score, confusion matrix and Classification Report  

### Task 5 : Prediction on Test Data

## Conclusion : 
- RandomForest is best at predicting Handwritten digits ie it got accuracy of 96%
- Naive Bayes is not good for predciting Handwritten digits
